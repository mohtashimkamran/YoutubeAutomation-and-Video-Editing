# YoutubeAutomation-and-Video-Editing

Py program which takes 2 input from user :-
Video title which you want to download
Audio which you want to mix in your video 
This program automatically searches both of them and download in desired quality and then adds the audio as background to the video.
Will be adding some more things in the code like video-audio edit part and then automate it to upload on youtube with a thumbnail


install selenium and all the libraries mentioned in py program
keep both the chrome window in same constant window size and dont alter that
